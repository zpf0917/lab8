Objective:

This lab introduces events and listeners, a paradigm that is
particularly useful in the programming of front-end applications.
Event programming in the back-end has also grown in popularity
with the rise of Node.js.

                         Events and Listeners

Imagine that you were writing an operating system and wanted to provide
an application programming interface (API) for programmers to write a
user interface. Given what you've learned, how would you design this
API? You might create an abstraction for drawing, so that
an application could call a method in your API to draw a button.
This has the benefit of allowing you to control the button style
throughout the whole OS, and the application's developer need
only call a single method to draw a button in an application. 

Once you've added buttons to your API, how would you allow 
client applications to react to, say, a mouse click? 
One way might be to add a function parameter to the button creation 
method. The function that is passed on creation of the button
could then be executed each time the user
presses the button. This type of parameter is referred to as a *callback*:
a function that is passed to another function, which the latter
then executes at the appropriate time. (Higher-order
functional programming makes this approach very natural.)

Now imagine a more complex situation: you would like to allow the user
to interact with buttons in a myriad of ways. Perhaps the user
could long-click, double-click, right-click, or maybe even use the
keyboard to activate the button. An application might require
different behavior in each case; that would mean many individual
callbacks. Adding parameters for each type of interaction quickly
becomes untenable. 

One solution to this problem is to leverage *events*. Programmers
using your API write functions that are designed to handle
various events, like a keyboard press or a right-click, and notify
the API which functions react to these events by "registering" the
functions for those events.

JavaScript makes frequent use of this paradigm. For example, you might 
have code that executes a function when 
the "onclick" event is fired. This event is named appropriately: 
it is the one that is fired upon clicking an on-screen object.

In the end, there are several requirements for events to work: we must
define an event itself (like "onclick"), have listeners for those
events (like a function that is executed in response to the "onclick"
event), and provide a mechanism that "fires" the event.

This lab walks through each of these steps to build a simple event
system. First, we'll define an event interface.  *)

(* An interface for an event module. *)
module type WEVENT =
sig
  (* The event listener identifier type. *)
  type id

  (* The event type. *)
  type 'a event

  (* new_event -- Creates a new event. *)
  val new_event : unit -> 'a event

  (* add_listener event listener -- Adds a listener to an event, which
     is called every time the event is fired. Returns an identifier for
     the listener. *)
  val add_listener : 'a event -> ('a -> unit) -> id

  (* remove_listener event id -- Removes a listener (identified by its
     id) from an event, so it is no longer called when the event is
     fired. Has no effect if the listener is not listening for that
     event. *)
  val remove_listener : 'a event -> id -> unit

  (* fire_event event arg -- Signals that an event has occurred. The
     arg is passed to each listener waiting for the event. *)
  val fire_event : 'a event -> 'a -> unit
end

(* Below are the beginnings of an implementation of the interface.
Look at the interface, above, for descriptions of each function. *)
  
module WEvent : WEVENT =
struct
  type id = int

  (* In this implementation, an event will be made up of a list of
  "waiters", each of which includes a unique ID for the listener (which will
  allow us to manage it later), and the listener itself. The listener
  is an event handler, or a function that will execute when the event
  is "fired". *)
  type 'a waiter = {id : id; action : 'a -> unit}
  type 'a event = 'a waiter list ref

  (* New IDs should be unique ints; we'll increment from 0. *)
  let id_counter = ref 0

  let new_id () : id =
    let i = !id_counter in
    incr id_counter; i

  let new_event () : 'a event = ref []

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1: Write add_listener, which adds a listener to an
event. Consider the explanations of waiters and events, above, to
decide how to implement this.
......................................................................*)
                                                   
  let add_listener (evt : 'a event) (listener : 'a -> unit) : id =
    failwith "WEvent.add_listener not implemented"

(*......................................................................
Exercise 2: Write remove_listener, which, given an id and an event,
unregisters the listener with that id from the event if there is
one. If there is no listener with that id, do nothing.
......................................................................*)
            
  let remove_listener (evt : 'a event) (i : id) : unit =
    failwith "WEvent.remove_listener not implemented"

(*......................................................................
Exercise 3: Write fire_event, which will execute all event handlers
listening for the event.
......................................................................*)
            
  let fire_event (evt : 'a event) (arg : 'a) : unit =
    failwith "WEvent.fire_event not implemented"

end

               A sample application: Newswire headlines

Let's now put this to use by creating a newswire. In this example,
reporters on the ground can create events that fire when they discover
a news headline in the field. News outlets subscribe to these events
and publish the headlines. *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 4: Given your implementation of Event, create a new event
called "newswire" that should pass strings to the event handlers.
......................................................................*)
  
let newswire = fun _ -> failwith "newswire not implemented" ;;

(* News organizations might want to register event listeners to the
newswire so that they might report on stories. Below are functions
for two organizations that accept headlines and "publish" stories (to
stdout) in different ways. *)
            
let fakeNewsNetwork (s : string) : unit =
  Printf.printf "BREAKING NEWS %s\n" s ;;

let buzzFake (s : string) : unit =
  Printf.printf "YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE %s\n" s ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 5: Register these two news organizations as listeners to the
newswire event.
......................................................................*)
  
(* .. *)

(* Here are some headlines to play with. *)

let h1 = "the national animal of Eritrea is officially the camel!" ;;
let h2 = "camels can run in short bursts up to 40mph!" ;;
let h3 = "bactrian camels can weigh up to 2200lbs!" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 6: Finally, fire newswire events with the above three
headlines, and observe what happens!
......................................................................*)
  
(* .. *)

(* Imagine now that you work at Facebook, and you're growing concerned
with the proliferation of fake news. To combat the problem, you decide
that headlines shouldn't be published right when the wires flash them;
instead, they should be reviewed and approved first, and not
printed until approved. The first step is to make sure that
the publications don't publish right away. *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 7: Remove the newswire listeners that were previously registered.
......................................................................*)

(* .. *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 8: Create a new event called publish to signal that all
stories should be published. The event should be a unit WEvent.event.
......................................................................*)

let publish = fun _ -> failwith "publish not implemented" ;; 

(*......................................................................
Exercise 9: Write a function receive_report to handle new news
stories. The function will be used as a listener on the newswire
event, but instead of publishing the headline immediately, it will
delay publication until after the publish event is fired. It does so
by registering appropriate listeners, one for each news network,
waiting for the publish event.
......................................................................*)

let receive_report = fun _ -> failwith "report not implemented";;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 10: Register the receieve_report listener to listen for the
newswire event.
......................................................................*)

(* .. *)

(* Here are some new headlines to use for testing this part. *)

let h4 = "today's top story: memes." ;; 
let h5 = "you can lose 20 pounds in 20 minutes!" ;; 
let h6 = "sheep have wool, not hair." ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 11: Fire newswire events for these headlines. Notice that (if
properly implemented), the newswire event doesn't immediately print
the news. (They've just queued up a bunch of listeners on the publish
event instead.)
......................................................................*)

(* .. *)

print_string "Moved to publication.\n" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 12: Finally, make sure that firing the publish event prints
out the headlines. You should see the headlines printed after
the line above. 
......................................................................*)
